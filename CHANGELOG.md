# @juriadams/timed-fetch

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 845840f: Convert TimedResponse from type to class with improved console.log output. The Response now properly displays timing information when logged, instead of showing "Response { ... }". Added custom inspect and toJSON methods for better debugging experience.
- c2d914f: Bumped version
